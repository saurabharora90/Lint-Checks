Dark Theme Lint
=================

A collection of Lint Checks to aid with the development and maintenance of dark theme in your android apps.

This will warn when colors are hardcoded (eg: `android:textColor="#FFFFFF"`) in layout or drawable files. It will also warn about color resources that donâ€™t have corresponding dark theme (`night` qualifier) variants.
